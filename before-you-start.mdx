## Environments

EPIC operates in two main environments to ensure reliable service delivery:

### Production Environment
The live environment where actual club operations take place. All real bookings, payments, and member activities occur here.

### QA Environment  
The testing environment used for quality assurance, feature testing, and training purposes. This environment mirrors production but uses test data.

## Access and Permissions

EPIC uses a role-based access control system with different permission levels for various user types:
